# RoleBasedAccessControl
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system manages user access based on roles, ensuring users only access relevant resources. Admins assign roles (Admin, Manager, User) with specific permissions (view, edit, delete). The system uses JWT for authentication, and permissions are enforced on both frontend and backend.
